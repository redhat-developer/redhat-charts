The following catalogs are available via RedHat OpenShift Container Platform console :

- IBM Operator Catalog
- IBMCS Operators 

Note: Products installed via operators with these catalogs may require purchase and entitlement.

Navigate via Administrator->Operators->OperatorHub and select Provider Type filter 
to view operators available within these custom catalogs.  

Steps to verify the IBM Catalogs are available : 
1. oc -n openshift-marketplace get catalogsource ibm-operator-catalog -o jsonpath="{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState}"
2. Verify the state returned is 'READY'
3. oc -n openshift-marketplace get catalogsource opencloud-operators -o jsonpath="{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState}"
